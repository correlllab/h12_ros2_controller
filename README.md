# h12_ros2_controller

Controller of the h12 robot with ROS2 services

## Installation

- All the dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt`\
- Version numbers are determined by installing everything through pip in a separated conda environment defined in `environment.yml`.
- Make sure you are using system-level python3, run `pip install -e .` to install all the dependencies.
- Install the Unitree Python SDK from [here](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python/tree/master)
  so the code can communicate with the robot.
